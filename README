Simplified test project for possible openlane bug:

 * the main branch works (and has a working gate-level simulation)
 * the split_bus branch hangs openlane at "clock_skew_report"

This project is tiny and needs something like the following in the config.tcl file:

set ::env(FP_SIZING) absolute
set ::env(DIE_AREA) "0 0 200 200"
